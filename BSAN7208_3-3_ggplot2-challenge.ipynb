Load the ggplot2 package\n2. Familiarise yourself with the fuel efficiency dataset `mpg` (open its documentation with the command `?mpg`)\n3. Visualise the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency on the highway with a scatterplot\n4. Add a trend line\n5. Colour the points according to the type of car (but make sure you still end up with one single trend line)\n6. Change the shape of the points according to the type of drive\n7.
